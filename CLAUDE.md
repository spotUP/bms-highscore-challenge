- remember, never use emojis for buttons, use clean line art icons
- remember to always prompt user to apply sql fixes in the supabase web ui, don't try yourself
- remember The large database files (2GB+ SQLite files, XML metadata) were excluded from the commit as they're development artifacts that don't belong in
  version control. The essential code changes and smaller configuration files were successfully pushed.
